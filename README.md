# TicTacToe
Implements a simple TicTacToe game. Options to play against trained Q-Learning and Maximin algorithms
Hard mode is the Maximin Algorithm.
AI mode is a partially-trained Q-learning algorithm. Play as X to play a trained agent, and play as O to play a naive agent. The difference is pretty apparent!

You can also train the agent, and its memory will automatically update.

The memory.csv file is the qtable, and should be in the same directory as the script.
